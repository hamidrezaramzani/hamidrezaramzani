# Hey, I'm Hamidreza

I build clean, fast web apps and enjoy hacking on side projects.  
Just started exploring Elixir – loving the vibe so far.

## ⚙️ Tools I use
- React, TypeScript, Tailwind
- Node.js, Express, pnpm
- Manjaro Sway, Neovim

## 🎧 Sound experiments
In my free time, I write instrumental music – mostly ambient, emotional stuff.  
Currently working on a piece inspired by the natural cycle of trees:  
**growth, decay, stillness, rebirth.**  
It’s about the quiet moments, the transitions, and the beauty in change.
